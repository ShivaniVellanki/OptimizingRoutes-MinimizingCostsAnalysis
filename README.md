# OptimizingRoutes-MinimizingCostsAnalysis
 The project examines strategies for cost-effectively transporting hazardous waste, revealing intermediate points as cheaper than direct shipping. It also explores investment strategies for a low-risk, 11% return on a $10,000 portfolio, demonstrating the risk-return relationship and advocating for strategic investment and operational decisions.

 This analysis explores two main strategies for Rockhill Shipping & Transport Company regarding the cost-effective shipment of hazardous waste from Chimotoxic's six factories to three disposal sites. Part I of the project utilizes a transshipment model to compare direct shipping costs against using intermediate points for waste transport. By calculating costs associated with moving waste directly from production sites to disposal facilities versus routing through intermediate points, the analysis seeks to identify the most economical shipping method. Solver tools in Excel are employed to find the minimum shipping cost under both scenarios, revealing that utilizing intermediate points significantly reduces expenses compared to direct shipments.

Part II shifts focus to an investment strategy aiming to achieve a minimum 11% return on a $10,000 portfolio with the lowest risk, utilizing quadratic programming. By examining historical asset performance and employing solver to distribute investments across various asset classes, the project assesses risk versus return profiles. Sensitivity analysis further explores how changes in expected returns impact risk, illustrating the relationship between higher returns and increased risk. The study concludes that intermediate shipping presents a more cost-effective approach for the company, and carefully chosen investment allocations can achieve desired returns at minimal risk levels, offering strategic insights for both operational and investment decisions.
